HEY, Sagar here 👋

Since the beginning of my coding journey, I’ve always wanted to build a real-time chat application.
We use chat apps every day, but creating your own from scratch feels completely different — and honestly, 
a little crazy 😄.

The main reason I built this project was simple:
to see whether I could turn something I imagined into something that actually works.

This is the first time I used WebSockets in a Spring Boot backend and connected it with a React frontend.
There were challenges, bugs, and a lot of learning along the way — but seeing it work in real time was totally worth it.

I know this project can be improved further, and I plan to keep enhancing it over time.
For now, I’m proud of what I’ve built and what I learned from it.

Thanks for taking the time to check out my code — I hope you like it 😊



PROJECT DISCRIPTION


Chatto – Real-Time Chat Application
	A full-stack real-time chat application built using Spring Boot and React,
	featuring JWT-based authentication, protected routes, and WebSocket (STOMP) 
	messaging for live communication.
	
Features
	Authentication & Security
		User registration & login
		JWT access token based authentication
		Secure REST APIs with Spring Security
		Protected frontend routes using token validation
		Automatic logout on token expiration
	
	Real-Time Chat (WebSocket)
		Real-time messaging using WebSocket + STOMP
		Secure WebSocket handshake with JWT validation
		User session tracking via WebSocket interceptors
		Join / leave notifications
		Messages broadcasted to all connected users

	Backend (Spring Boot)
		REST APIs for authentication and user validation
		WebSocket configuration using @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
		Custom WebSocket Handshake Interceptor for JWT verification
		Centralized exception handling
		MongoDB integration for user persistence
		Clean layered architecture:
			Controller
			Service
			Repository
			DTO
			Security
			


Frontend (React + TypeScript)
	React with TypeScript
	ProtectedRoute implementation
	Axios interceptor for automatic token injection
	Custom React Hook for WebSocket (useChatSocket)
	Real-time UI updates without page refresh
	Message formatting with username display
	Clean component-based structure
